# Introduction

The goal of this project is to classify the emotions in text using a Machine Learning model built with the streamlit framework. The project showcases the steps involved in tokenizing text, bulid pipline, training the model, and predicting emotions in input text.

# Prerequisites

# clone the repository :
git clone https://github.com/chavanavi/Emotion_in_text-project

# Before running the code, ensure you have the required libraries installed:
pandas ,
numpy ,
altair , 
streamlit 
# You can install them using the following command:
pip install pandas ,
pip install numpy  ,
pip install seaborn   ,
pip install matplotlib   ,
pip install neattext

# Data Preprocessing
The code starts with loading and preprocessing text data. It tokenizes the text, pads sequences, encodes labels, and prepares the data for model training.

# Model Architecture
The neural network model architecture is defined using the streamlit . It consists of an defined using the Pipline specified activation functions.

# Model Training
The model is compiled LogisticRegression function, then trained using the prepared training data. Validation data is used to monitor the model's performance during training.

# Emotion Prediction
The trained model is used to predict emotions in input text. An example input text is preprocessed, and the model predicts the corresponding emotions emoji .
